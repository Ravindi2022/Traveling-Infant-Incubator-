# Traveling-Infant-Incubator-

This project aimed to address the critical need for accessible and reliable infant incubator 
transportation in regions with limited medical facilities, focusing specifically on the context 
of Sri Lanka. The primary problem addressed was the lack of efficient and safe transportation 
for infants requiring neonatal care between hospitals. The objectives were to develop a 
portable infant incubator equipped with real-time monitoring capabilities and an alert system 
to ensure timely medical intervention during transit. 
 
The system was implemented using an ESP8266 microcontroller along with Max30100 and 
DHT11 sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, heart rate, and pulse oximetry readings. 

Data was collected and transmitted to a mobile application developed using Blynk, providing 
real-time monitoring for medical staff and caregivers. 
An alert system was integrated to notify ambulance drivers and staff of any deviations from 
safe parameters, prompting immediate action if necessary
